                <p class="lorem">A hill fort has existed in Talsi at least since the 10th century, originally inhabited
                    by Curonians.[5] The settlement of Talsi is mentioned in written sources for the first time in 1231
                    during the Middle Ages, in a contract between the elders of a Curonian tribe and the papal envoy
                    Baldwin von Alna.[6][7] During the Northern Crusades, the settlement came under German over-lordship
                    and a castle was built in Talsi during the late 13th century. The settlement grew in the 15th
                    century, when traders and artisans from German-speaking lands settled in Talsi. The presently
                    visible main church of the town was inaugurated in 1567; pastor Carl Amenda [de], a close friend of
                    Ludwig van Beethoven, worked in the church for many years. During the reign of Duke Jacob Kettler,
                    an iron smelting furnace was constructed in Talsi, an early industrial development. The town has
                    suffered from the plague twice (1657 and 1710) and was devastated by a large fire in 1733. The town
                    became part of the Russian Empire in 1795 together with the rest of Courland. At that time, Baltic
                    Germans constituted about sixty percent of the population.[8] At the end of the 18th century, Jews
                    were allowed to settle in Talsi for the first time. Most of the Jews who settled in Talsi originally
                    came from Lithuania and would with time come to form a substantial part of the town population.
                    Eventually a synagogue was built in Talsi
                    19th century and World War I
                    An elementary school opened in 1863 and a private school in 1873 (the latter was for many years the
                    workplace of linguist Kārlis Mīlenbahs); both schools initially taught only in German. In 1887 a
                    Russian-language school was also opened in Talsi. During the Revolution of 1905, there was unrest in
                    the town and several houses burned down and inhabitants killed. During World War I the town suffered
                    heavily and its population decreased from around 5,000 to about 1,100. The entire Jewish population
                    was expelled by Russian military authorities (but some would later return). Peace was not entirely
                    restored until 1920, with the end of the Latvian War of Independence which made Talsi part of the
                    newly proclaimed Latvian republic.[8][9]

                    In independent Latvia and during the 20th century
                    The town grew rapidly again and in 1935 had 4116 inhabitants (82% ethnic Latvians, 12% Jews and 3%
                    Germans). The town was under German occupation from 3 July 1941 right up until the end of World War
                    II on 9 May 1945.[11] The occupying German army used one of the buildings in Talsi as a place where
                    they tortured prisoners; during the Soviet times a bas-relief was put up in commemoration of the
                    victims on the wall of the house. During the Nazi occupation the town's entire Jewish population was
                    murdered. The Germans were aided by ethnic Latvian collaborators. A single Jewish woman was hidden
                    by a local farmer but discovered in 1944 and killed.[8][9]

                    The 1950s and 60s were a time of relative prosperity. The town had a forceful leader in Kārlis
                    Grīnbergs, chairman of Talsi Executive Committee (as the town now was part of the Latvian Soviet
                    Socialist Republic under Soviet occupation). A metalworking plant was opened in 1965 that would
                    attract many jobs to the town. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the
                    re-establishment of Latvia's independence, one of the main monuments of the town, a sculpture called
                    Koklētājs and dedicated to the Latvian freedom fighters could finally be inaugurated. It was begun
                    during the 1930s but could not be finished until after the fall of the Soviet Union
